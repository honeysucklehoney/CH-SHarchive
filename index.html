<div class="content" >
<p>
  July, 2020
  <br><br>
  My roommates and I moved to a new apartment 2 weeks ago. Looking around, I don’t think it has been renovated since the 70’s, but most of our furniture is from the same decade and I wear almost exclusively bell-bottoms -- so our grandmotherly floral couch, the excessive amount of wood paneling and me, with my aesthetic nostalgia, make a fine pairing. Since moving in, I spend most of my time in the apartment either sitting in, or staring at, the kitchen while I work and type away (like I am right now). I like kitchens a lot. Not because I love food, but because I see them as a work (shops/spaces) and they are my favourite places for collaboration. So much can be done in such a little space. Every kitchen is filled with multifunctional tools. A pot can be used for cooking, making wheat paste or sterilizing a needle. The kitchen is already full of tools -- tools to feed, tools that can cause pain, tools that contain, tools to share, prepare, serve, heat and cool-down. A lot of what I want in a learning environment, and in my studio, can be expressed or found through the kitchen and its objects.
<br><br>
A quick inventory of my kitchen thus far: a billion glasses of all colours (given to us by grandmothers and grandmotherly figures in our lives), 4 bowls, 5 plates, a few knives, 1 pot, 1 pan, 3 walls and 1 wall that isn’t real but rather a large peg board that acts as a divider between the kitchen and the adjacent furnace room. When I moved in, all that was left on the peg board were
some hooks and some light scratches on the paint, suggesting what might have hung there before. It reminded me of a series of drawings by Hazel Meyer for the online publication, “No more Potlucks”. The drawings show a series of tools compiled on a pegboard with empty spaces for those that were currently in-use. Meyer was attempting to make her own utopian feminist toolbox filled with tools of resistance that were “100% guaranteed to fail some of the time”. There are empty spaces on her pegboard like mine. Some of her tools are in-use or have yet to be found. My kitchen pegboard has a lot of empty spaces waiting to be filled with tools to build new realities.
<br><br>
Right now, I am looking for tools to build my kitchen into my workshop and to create a place to host epic kitchen parties* A good kitchen party involves many people making food, lots of conversational chatter and spontaneous music sessions that carry on into the night. A successful kitchen party is a successful act of collaboration and skill sharing in the name of a good time. Like my kitchen I want my learning environment to be an active site for collaboration. I want teaching and nourishing to be synonymous. Nourishing the body and the brain go hand in hand.
<br><br>
My earliest memory of making a mark was learning to write/spell in flour sprinkled on a baking sheet. I traced out the words, pushing the power around with my finger and shaking the pan when I was done. Pencils were hard for me to grasp, but the flour was soft and my marks were dissolvable. It felt like a more comfortable tool. I still remember the gentle ticklish feeling of slowly tracing letters. I would play in the flour while my mom would cook dinner-using the same tools. The acts of learning and nourishing were connected.
<br><br>
Touch, smell and taste all have a seat at the (kitchen) table. All the senses should be used in teaching. This is why I am looking for a large soup pot to put up on my pegboard. Learning to natural dye taught me to be more observant with smell and touch and the importance of considering my waste and the ecosystems I live within. I learned about my friends’ stories and aspirations too, all while watching a natural dye bath simmer on the stove filling the room with the calming scent of pine needles.
Listening to plants and to people, learning what they can do for us and in turn what we can do for them. Working around a dye pot and collecting dye-materials are exercises in maintaining relationships or mutual care. My learning space and toolbox need things that can make colour and can tell stories through taste, touch and smell.
<br><br>
I’m looking around at my kitchen. (Forgive me, but this is also a good exercise in what I still need to pick up for my place). Good Lord, I need more bowls! Even for 3 people, 4 bowls hardly cuts the mustard. Even in a speculative learning environment you have to have the basics. Feels obvious to say, but nonetheless… And in my space I need to host small groups of people-- 10,11,12 (?). The more the merrier. But I like being in small spaces which generally keeps the number of people at a dozen or so. I may need more chairs or maybe to just go outside? If it were outdoors it could be more accessible. There needs to be many entry points, physically and for contributing.
I’m now drifting away from my kitchen and am in a food forest filled with food and fibre plants -- and a pegboard--in the center of the garden filled with tools: instruments to play, an electric stove, a large soup pot, 14 bowls (because you should always have a few extra), multicolour glassware sparking in the sunlight and empty spaces for things not yet known or currently being used. These tools that started in the kitchen have brought me this far.
<br><br>
I went back onto the Craigslist posting of the apartment that has photos of the place before I moved in, providing the only evidence of what hung on the pegboard before me. I'm comparing the marks in front of me with the Craigslist photo that shows it filled up with pots and pans. The marks don’t line up. I guess the people before them might have scratched the paint, or maybe the last tenants redecorated at some point. I like thinking they had their own toolbox different from mine and from the people before them. I like that this pegboard never got repainted. I like that I can see what was there before, offering me a chance to learn from those who came before. Like maybe I should own more than one pan. This is what I love about kitchens-they are filled with spontaneous collaboration.
<br><br>
*A kitchen party is a term used a lot in Eastern Canada to describe an informal dinner party. Similar to a BBQ, however they take place inside and a lot of people pack into a tiny kitchen. Traditionally, they took place in the kitchen because it was the warmest part of the house in the winter.

<div class="content">
  <p>August, 2021
    <br><br>
    Walking into Means of Production Garden, the willow trees greet you, holding hands. The Empress trees stand 20 feet tall like columns to nowhere. The garden has grown into architecture and has been my current on-site office space this summer.
<br><br>
This past week I had been having a terrible time. My climate anxiety was through the roof, and my bike got stolen, leaving me to find a solution fast as it was my main source of transportation. Emotionally drained, feeling lonely, and all together stuck in doomer mode, I went to a live performance in Means of Production Garden that weekend, and I left feeling steady again. The band played instruments made from the trees growing in the garden. The people all around me fostered their friendships there. For a few hours, I participated in the social harvest that Earthand Gleaners grows each year.
<br><br>
Over the past few months, I have spent my days learning about plants, their uses, and how to catalog them into an online repository. I have improved my analog photography skills,  javascript coding, gardening skills, and way more. My time with Earthand was so special, however,  because of the community. You can learn to code or the names of plants anywhere but walk into a space so full of life intersecting with one another in moments of shared learning is special; it is what made my work here so inspiring. Coding a digital garden has been a chance to take the dogma of Earthand and translate it into an online platform. It has been incredibly insightful to work in the space of translation. It provided me with the chance to analyze what makes my time here so special and distill it into qualities replicable (in my case, in digital space).
<br><br>
I wish I could stay and see the garden in all the seasons. I am glad I could enjoy the summer, but like any good thing, I wish it could last longer. I have loved growing with the plants under the care of Earthand. I want everyone I know to come here and learn, and I want to stay.

<br><br>
During my time on “Fogo Island” I came to notice that on an island of roughly 2,500 people - even as a beginner - you might be the only one who knows something about a particular subject. This was somewhat the case for me with my natural dyeing practice. I remember Mikaela picking me up from work one day to tell me that Nora N. Khan, an artist-in-residence staying on the island, had asked if “the dye lady” (me lol) could teach her how to dye fabric with local plant life. Ha! I was meandering through the hills by my house for fun with some botany books collecting plants that I thought looked right. How was I supposed to teach anything? The ability to enjoy being an amateur made “Fogo Island” a welcoming place to incubate new ideas. I felt comfortable learning and sharing my small successes. It wasn’t about being a master, but rather sharing what we did know with each other and being transparent with our learning. In the case of teaching natural dyeing, we collected plants together and tested them in my kitchen to see what they did.
<br><br>
Similarly, it was the lack of pressure to be an expert that led me to take up skateboarding. I was learning how to skate in the same way I was learning how to forage for dye materials. Asking self-reflective questions like “does this feel right?” and “will this hurt me?” Falling and being a beginner out in the open didn’t faze me because I had the room to make mistakes. The first time I got on a skateboard was with the support of a group of older queer friends who I respected and admired. Combined with sewing, cooking, and hanging out, learning to skate felt like picking up any other skill. It wasn’t until I left “Fogo Island” and moved to the traditional homelands of the Narragansett and Wampanoag peoples which is now called, “Providence, Rhode Island,” that I encountered the challenges of being an amateur in a space that felt foreign. I was still a beginner, but unlike skating on “Fogo Island,” where my fledgling skills were embraced, I found I had become really insecure about my skill level in “Providence.” I didn’t realize how special learning to skateboard on “Fogo Island” had been. What made the place so rich for learning new skills was the encouragement from a supportive community that embraced amateurism in everyone.
<br><br>
Three years later I look back at my time on “Fogo Island” skateboarding as a reminder that its not that a skill is not met for me but rather that I have yet to find my way of learning. It is in the way my friends made an ecosystem of learing I want to share with others in my practice.

    January, 2022.
<br><br>
    Up until recently, there is one computer in my life at a time. It is the fastest and most available one. For me, this has been my Macbook Pro. Although almost indistinguishable from the one it replaced, I have been thinking about the latter longingly. It has one difference from my current mac, a beauty mark, permanent water damage to the lower part of the screen rendering a third of the monitor darker than the rest.  It's my screen half-full perspective to see this misfortune as a good thing.
<br><br>

The water damage happened when I was late to work, leaving my phone in a lecture hall earlier that afternoon. I had to run back to school. I burst into an auditorium full of a hundred strangers only to make my acquaintance by holding them auditorily hostage with the find my phone emergency alarm till my phone was found. My quick thinking turned more reckless as ran to catch the subway in the rain with no umbrella.  By the time I made it to the subway, my laptop and I were drenched. The memory of that afternoon is preserved by permit water damage. A two-toned screen has one perk, though. I could always see if a color I was working with would look better, just a few shades darker and bluer. I adapted out of necessity, although now if I had the option to use either of the two near-identical computers  I don’t know which I would choose.
<br><br>

A lesson I have learned in school is to see everything as a tool with a specific use, intended or not. Intentional craft comes from good planning and comprehension of tools. I was taught this lesson in relationship to fine woodworking but I have come to adapt it into my perspective on hardware and computation.
<br><br>

<br><br>

This autumn a blossoming interest in hardware was pollinated by a gift to play with a Macintosh Plus computer from the late ’80s. It was easy to investigate its innards. The first thing I did was explore how to could alter its inputs and outputs like its software ports and power source. The computer came into my possession through an act of urban gleaning. It seemed fitting that the computer is powered by a gleaned source as well. In December, I powered the macintosh plus with one gigantic apple battery. Over 50 apples were connected with pennies, nails, and wire in a series circuit. An apple power apple computer ran MacPaint. To house my power source, I built a cabinet out of used sweet-corn creates that could hold apples and the apples that could no longer supply power–immortalized as apple dolls.
<br><br>

My apple powered computer caught the attention of many of my friends who never thought they could become interested in techy things. It was a great success for me and deepened my appreciation of intentional tool making in computation. One friend commissioned me to build her a produce-powered computer to run a video in an exhibition.  Considering my friend’s needs probed me to give language to the internal questions I was asking myself in what I desired from a computer. My perspective on my computer became introspection of the self and my current environmental factors. I created a checklist for computational tools that position themselves within their environment, communities, and the individual user.
<br><br>
<u> Checklist for consideration into a good personal computer:</u>
<br><br>
⚘ The locality of hardware: What location will a computer will be in and during what season?<br>
⚘ The right flaw: technological pitfalls or glitches would be helpful flaws for her work?<br>
⚘ Alteration through use: does an act of destruction or repair create a more desirable tool? <br>
⚘ Necessary processing abilities or upgradability<br>
⚘ Comfort*
